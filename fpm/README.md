FPM
---

[FPM] is an excellent tool for building RPM packages quickly. It can be used to
build a Bunktate RPM with very little effort. This directory contains the
bits and pieces necessary to help make that happen.

WARNING
=======

This works in *my* environment, but it might need to be tweaked a little for
yours - in particular, I install to `/usr/local/bunktate/`, which might not be
for you.
